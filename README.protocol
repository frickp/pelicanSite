**Using below method won't give the right code display (color, etc)
Alternaltively, could just copy/paste in the figures from the working html file


To publish R-studio content, 
1) Knit the file as an html file and save the html.
2) Open text editor and copy and paste the following (from http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html):
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My super title</title>
        <meta name="tags" content="thats, awesome" />
        <meta name="date" content="2012-07-09 22:28" />
        <meta name="modified" content="2012-07-10 20:14" />
        <meta name="category" content="yeah" />
        <meta name="authors" content="Alexis MÃ©taireau, Conan Doyle" />
        <meta name="summary" content="Short version for index and feeds" />
    </head>
    <body>
        This is the content of my super blog post.
    </body>
</html>
3) Open RStudio-generated html file in a text editor. Copy the body of the file (the part between the 
two <body> commands). Keeping anything else will prevent the post from displaying online. Paste
this content between the two <body> commands in the new document in the text editor
4) Update the annotations, etc in the first line. 
That's it! Pelican should be able to handle the file just fine now.
