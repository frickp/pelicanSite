Summary: PhD R code

Here, I just want to show some of my R code that I wrote for analyzing cancer cell drug responses by high-throughput microscopy. I've modified the code to that it is in a copy-and-paste format. So... you should be able to recreate it in a couple easy steps!

I have this optimized for use on mac computers (n=2). Follow these steps  


1. Install R (R-website)
    - note, that this is optimized for version XXX.
2. Follow this link and click on any of the .R files in the directory.
3. Copy and paste any of these scripts into the R console and hit return
    -  if you don't have the required packages installed, the script will ask you if you want to install it. Press "Y" and then "return" when prompted.
    -  paste the script and rerun it.
    -  repeat until no more error messages are seen.
4. That's it!

Ok, so what is the code doing? First, it is reading in analysis functions. What do each of these do?
