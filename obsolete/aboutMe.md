When I took my first college physics class, I remember being fascinated with how mathematics could demystify complex systems through modeling. After that I was hooked. This fascination led me to Vanderbilt University to study systems biology, a subfield of biology that uses big data, mathematics and statistics.

At Vanderbilt I worked with biologists, statisticians, and mathematicians to predict more effective cancer therapies. What I enjoyed the most was bringing a quantitative angle to study difficult problems, leveraging big data and modeling. Seeking to build upon this theme led me to study genomics at Stanford University.
